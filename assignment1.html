    <h2> Senior information systems major </h2>

    <p> I've come to really enjoy coding, I remember I thought coding was rocket science and I always said I would never want to learn it. Now here I am- fully embracing it. I feel like my brain is being exercised. I'm from the south side of Chicago, nobody ever teaches you this stuff. If you dont get a chance to go to college like I did- you either sell drugs or go to jail- literally. </p>

      <p> One thing that I would say saved me is basketball. I have been playing my entire life and I had the opportunity to play in college, I received many offers, but a run into with the law- I lost them. I came to Howard as a last minute option, I walked on the basketball team my freshman year and my senior year. I'm currently training 4 to 5 days a week preparing for 5 professional combines this summer. I want to play professionally overseas and continue to work on my new start-up/Mobile app called 24/7 Competition </p>
